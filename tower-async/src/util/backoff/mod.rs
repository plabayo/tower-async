//! This module contains generic [backoff] utilities to be used with the retry
//! and limit layers.
//!
//! The [`Backoff`] trait is a generic way to represent backoffs that can use
//! any timer type.
//!
//! [`ExponentialBackoffMaker`] implements the maker type for  
//! [`ExponentialBackoff`] which implements the [`Backoff`] trait and provides
//! a batteries included exponential backoff and jitter strategy.
